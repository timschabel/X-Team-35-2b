# X-Team 35 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will discuss how to break the project up into sections, then communicate with each other to make sure everyone is on the same page.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will create our own "checkpoint" deadlines where we will communicate with each other before the actual deadline to see how far everyone is and if everyone is on track and knows what they are doing.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Talk to each other, ask for help, text.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
We will try to make our "checkpoint" deadlines, and if we don't we will communicate to make sure that everything gets done if it isn't done by then.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Keep communicating, try to have meetings when necessary.
